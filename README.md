# oibsip_takno-2 :Predicting Unemployment Rate in India

# Introduction:

Unemployment rate is a critical economic indicator reflecting the health of a country's labor market. Understanding and predicting unemployment trends can aid policymakers, businesses, and individuals in making informed decisions. This project aims to develop a predictive model for estimating unemployment rates in India based on historical data.

# Data Acquisition and Preprocessing:

Data Source:
   The dataset used in this project is sourced from [Unemployment in India.csv](file path). It contains information about unemployment rates, employment estimates, labor participation rates, and other relevant variables.
   
Data Preprocessing:
Missing Values:
Missing values in the dataset were handled by filling them with appropriate values. Categorical variables were filled with mode values, while numerical variables were filled with mean values.

Data Types:
The 'Date' column was converted to datetime format for time-series analysis.

Categorical Encoding: 
Categorical variables such as 'Region', 'Frequency', and 'Area' were encoded using Label Encoding to convert them into numerical form suitable for machine learning models.

Train-Test Split: 
The dataset was split into training and testing sets with a ratio of 80:20 for model training and evaluation.
# Model Development:

Model Selection: 
A RandomForestRegressor from the scikit-learn library was chosen for its ability to handle both numerical and categorical features, as well as its capability to capture non-linear relationships in the data.

Training: 
The model was trained on the training dataset using 100 decision trees (n_estimators=100) and a random state of 42 for reproducibility.

Evaluation:
The model's performance was evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE), a commonly used metric for regression tasks. MSE measures the average squared difference between the actual and predicted values of the target variable.

#  Conclusion:

The developed model demonstrates promising results in predicting unemployment rates in India based on historical data.
Further refinement of the model and exploration of additional features could potentially enhance its predictive accuracy.
The model can be utilized by policymakers, economists, and other stakeholders to gain insights into labor market dynamics and make informed decisions regarding employment policies and interventions.
#  Future Directions:

Feature Engineering: Explore additional features or transformations that may improve model performance.

Model Tuning: Fine-tune hyperparameters of the RandomForestRegressor or experiment with other regression algorithms to optimize performance.

External Factors: Incorporate external factors such as economic indicators, government policies, and global events to enhance the model's predictive capabilities.

Deployment: Develop a user-friendly interface or integrate the model into a larger decision support system for practical deployment and use.
